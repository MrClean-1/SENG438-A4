# Introduction
This assignment is completed in two parts. The first is about mutation testing where students learn how to use a mutation testing tool, inject mutation faults in Java code-base, how to evaluate the returned mutation scores, how to apply that information to create new test cases to improve the quality of the test suite. The second part is focussed on GUI testing using Selenium to learn about GUI testing automation, record, and replay. This tool will be compared to another tool. 

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 
## Range.combine(Range range1, Range range2)
PIT produced mutants for the first “if condition” in this method which is:

    if (range1 == null){ 
      return range2; 
    } 

##### 1. negated conditional → KILLED
The first mutant is “negated conditional” which was killed and this means that the mutant introduced in our if condition was: 

    if(range1 != null){ 
      return range2; 
    }

The mutant was killed because we had a test to check if range1 != null, then the method would return a combined range and not just range2.  

The test that killed this mutant was:  

    @Test 
    public void getCombineTest() {  
      Range combined = new Range(-99995.875, 139995.875); 
      assertEquals(combined, Range.combine(exampleRange, largeRange)); 
    } 

##### 2. removed conditional - replaced equality check with false → KILLED
The second mutant is “removed conditional” which was killed and this means that the mutant introduced in our if condition was: 

    if(false){ 
      return range2; 
    } 

The mutant was killed because we had a case to test if range1 is null, then the value should be range2 not a combined range.  

The test to kill this mutant was:  

    @Test 
    public void getCombineRange1NullTest() {  
      assertEquals(largeRange, Range.combine(null, largeRange)); 
    } 

##### 3. removed conditional - replaced equality check with true → KILLED
The third mutant is “removed conditional” which was killed and this means that the mutant introduced in our if condition was: 

    if(true){ 
      return range2; 
    } 

The mutant was killed because we had a test to check if range1 has a valid input, then the method would return a combined range and not just range2.  

The test that killed this mutant was:  

    @Test 
    public void getCombineTest() {  
      Range combined = new Range(-99995.875, 139995.875); 
      assertEquals(combined, Range.combine(exampleRange, largeRange)); 
    } 

##### 4. not equal to equal → KILLED
The fourth mutant is “not equal to equal” which was killed and this means that the mutant introduced in our if condition was: 

    if(!(range1==null)){ 
      return range2; 
    } 

This mutant was killed because we have a case that tests if range1 is not null, it should return a combined range, not just range2.  

The test that killed this mutant was:  

    @Test 
    public void getCombineTest() {  
    Range combined = new Range(-99995.875, 139995.875); 
    assertEquals(combined, Range.combine(exampleRange, largeRange)); 
    } 
    
## Range.scale(Range base, double factor)
PIT produced the following mutants for the first “if condition” in this method which is:
    if (factor < 0) {
       throw new IllegalArgumentException("Negative 'factor' argument.");
    }

###### 5. changed conditional boundary → SURVIVED
This mutant is “changed conditional boundary” which SURVIVED and this means that the mutant introduced in our if condition was:

    if (factor <= 0)

This mutant survived since we did not have a case where we had the value of factor at zero which is at the boundary.

##### 6. substituted 0.0 with 1.0 → SURVIVED
This mutant is “substituted 0.0 with 1.0” which SURVIVED and this means that the mutant introduced in our if condition was:

    if (factor < 1.0)

This mutant survived since we did not have a case where we had the value of factor as 1.0 which is double unlike in our case we used an integer.

##### 7. negated conditional → KILLED
This mutant is “negated conditional” was KILLED and this means that the mutant introduced in our if condition was:

    if (factor >= 0)

This mutant was killed because of the test case that we designed which is:
    @Test
    public void scaleTestGreaterThan0() {
    Range expected = new Range(2,2);
        assertEquals(expected, Range.scale(expected, 1));
    }

##### 8. removed conditional - replaced comparison check with false → KILLED
This mutant is “removed conditional - replaced comparison check with false” which was KILLED and this means that the mutant introduced in our if condition was:

    if (false)

This mutant was killed because of the test cases that we had, which are as follows:

    @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void scaleTest() {
      Range expected = new Range(2,2);
      assertEquals(expected, Range.scale(expected, -1));
    }
    
    @Test
    public void scaleTestGreaterThan0() {
      Range expected = new Range(2,2);
      assertEquals(expected, Range.scale(expected, 1));
    }
##### 9. removed conditional - replaced comparison check with true → KILLED
This mutant is “removed conditional - replaced comparison check with true” which was KILLED and this means that the mutant introduced in our if condition was:

    if (true)

This mutant was killed because of the test cases that we had. Which are as follows:
    @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void scaleTest() {
      Range expected = new Range(2,2);
      assertEquals(expected, Range.scale(expected, -1));
    }
    
    @Test
    public void scaleTestGreaterThan0() {
      Range expected = new Range(2,2);
      assertEquals(expected, Range.scale(expected, 1));
    }

##### 10. negated double local variable number 1 → KILLED
This mutant is “Negated double local variable number 1” which was KILLED and this means that the mutant introduced in our if condition was:

    if (-factor < 0)

This mutant was killed because of the test cases that we had. Which are as follows:

    @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void scaleTest() {
      Range expected = new Range(2,2);
      assertEquals(expected, Range.scale(expected, -1));
    }
    @Test
    public void scaleTestGreaterThan0() {
      Range expected = new Range(2,2);
      assertEquals(expected, Range.scale(expected, 1));
    }

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes
Both the test class for DataUtilities and the test class for Range are effective test classes. With DataUtilitiesTest we see 100% mutation coverage, which means that this test file would be suitable as a scripted set of tests. 
For RangeTest we see 95% mutation coverage, where only equivalent mutants are left uncaught. This would also be a suitable test suite for automated testing.
As well, some equivalent mutants hint at ways to further simplify and optimize the methods under test.

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy
Very few equivalent mutants were found during mutation testing, one notable find is within the public double constrain(double value) method in Range. The boundary value mutant that modifies the expressions in lines 190 & 193 changes a > to >=, and < to <=. This does not affect the function of the method since we have already checked if the value exists within the range. So that code becomes unreachable if you are trying to test what would happen if value = this.upper or this.lower.

As well, the public static Range expandToInclude(Range range, double value) method in Range has two equivalent mutants for similar reasons. when the value < range.getLowerBound() becomes <= the resulting behaviour is as we expect. It doesn't modify the functionality of the method and is therefore uncaught.

Another equivalent mutant that we discovered was the if (lower > upper) in public static Range expand(Range, double, double). if lower >= upper the same behaviour is observed. (You can do that math to check it, I did)

The last equivalent mutant that we found was within the shiftWithNoZeroCrossing function where if value = 0.0 changing the first if statement to >= 0 from > 0 causes the same behaviour.
In this case, the mutant is useful because this class can be further simplified. Instead of if, else if, else we can change the first if to >= 0 and the else if becomes an else statement instead and the same behaviour is observed.

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites
Nothing could have been done to further improve the mutation score of the test suite.

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing
Mutation testing is used to test the quality of the test suite. It is done to see how well the tests created perform, even when there is mutated code. This can result in adjustments to previously written tests or creation of more tests for better coverage. 

One of the advantages of mutation testing is that it will result in a better test suite by identifying weak test cases that were unable to kill mutants. It also results in an increase in code coverage of the source code. Ultimately, testing with mutations helps the team evaluate the quality of the source code. 

One disadvantage is that it is very time-consuming. In addition to this, mutation testing can only be done for white box testing as the source code is needed to do mutation testing. This type of testing shuold be automated with some tool or this method would be very difficult. It seems to only be practical for smaller and simpler code. For larger code, mutation testing becomes impractical. 

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process
The group got together and discussed common functionalities that can be done on the Amazon webiste. Then, we decided to divide up the 10 functionalities that we have identified. Once test scripts were created for the functionaliies, each member ran their tests again to see whether the test would pass again or not. For those that did not pass, the group discussied it to further understand why running the test scripts is different than recording the test script. For example, one functionality a member tested was REGISTER. Recording on Selenium to create the test script worked because we are ceating a new account and inserting data into the database that Amazon has never seen before. However, when we run the scripted test that Selenium recorded, it does not pass since the inputs are the same, which means that the user is already in the system and registration will not work. Members also tried using different inputs to see if the test will pass or not. 

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints
Assertions and checkpoints are used to state that the application behaves how it is expected to. These are helpful since they help testers know if the tests have passed or failed and why. Essentially, they help with verification. Verification is generally done automatically by the tool, which it is by Selenium. 

# How did you test each functionaity with different test data
To test each functionality with different test data, we created a new test to test the same functionality with different data. This can be shown for testing the login in function. We have two tests for login: one for when password is correct and another one for when password is incorrect. This was done because Selenium records text inputs for each test, so two tests must be created with different test inputs to test both sides of the functionality. 

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix
The group tried using both Selenium and Sikulix, and we have agreed that Selenium is significantly easier to use since actions/commands are recorded for us. With Sikulix, manual insertions of commands makes GUI testing much less efficient. However, based on our research, Sikulix can be used on other softwares such as desktop applications, not just on websites, which is one disadvantage Selenium has compared to Sikulix. This means that Sikulix is able to automate tests based on the GUI on the screen. Another major difference the group noticed was that while Selenium recorded actions, Sikulix uses image recognition. On the flip side, Selenium also records user input and can read text, which is something that the group noticed Sikulix could not do. One disadvantage that Sikulix has is that assertions and checkpoints will have to be manually entered-- is it not automated, unlike Selenium. In terms of ease of use, Selenium is preferred, but it also has its own drawbacks. Sikulix can be used on a variety of applications and on web tests, but it does less automation and is less efficient in web UI testing.    

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
The team met up and discussed the lab assignment before dividing tasks. Since running the PIT mutation tool worked only on some members' computers and not others, it was difficult to get started and divide tasks. To progress, members who were able to view Pit mutation reports, shared their reports so that the other members could evaluate and explain why or why not the test has killed the bug or has allowed the bug to survive. For GUI testing, the group individually completed their tasks, but  the group met up with each other so that everyone could verify work and ensure we were all on the same page. 

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
Using the new tools took some time to become familiar with them. Similar to previous labs, the instructions were vague but the group was able to figure out how to use the tools and complete tasks with time. As previously mentioned, Pit testing did not work on all devices. This was a challenge, but the group worked together to overcome this problem. The main lesson learned from this lab was how to use different testing tools and what mutation/GUI testing is like. 

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
The lab itself was great practice and allowed the group to become familiar with industry tools. Although the lab guidlines were vague at some parts, it was written better than past guidelines since the group was less confused about what was expected from the lab. Some of the provided files caused problems in Eclipse and made the process more difficult. The lab itself was manageable.

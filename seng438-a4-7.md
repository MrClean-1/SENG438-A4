# Introduction
This assignment is completed in two parts. The first is about mutation testing where students learn how to use a mutation testing tool, inject mutation faults in Java code-base, how to evaluate the returned mutation scores, how to apply that information to create new test cases to improve the quality of the test suite. The second part is focussed on GUI testing using Selenium to learn about GUI testing automation, record, and replay. This tool will be compared to another tool. 

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class



# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed


# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
